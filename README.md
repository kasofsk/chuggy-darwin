# chuggy-darwin

Runs a chuggy worker pool's jobs on a Mac, Apple silicon or Intel. It registers the machine as a pool and runs the pool, from a terminal or under a launchd agent that keeps it running. Jobs run as Linux containers through docker in Colima's VM, from the worker core chuggy-linux runs.

It needs Node 24 or later.

## Register

Mint a registration token for the pool in chuggy, then, from a checkout after `npm ci`:

```sh
./cli.mjs register --api <chuggy's origin> --token=<token>
```

Give the token with `=`: a token can begin with `-`, which `--token <token>` would read as an option.

Colima must be running: this asks docker which architecture its VM runs before it spends the token, then declares that platform, `Platform:Linux:Arm64` for an arm64 VM, as Colima's default is on Apple silicon, or `Platform:Linux:Amd64` for an x86_64 one, and writes the pool file chuggy answers with to `~/.config/chuggy/pools/`, named for its tenant, project and pool: `vteng.chuggy.shame.json`. `--api` must be https unless it is this machine's loopback. The secret goes only into the file, mode 600.

The pool takes the hostname's first label unless `--pool <name>` names it; a name is lowercase letters, digits and hyphens. Registering a pool again, from here or any machine, replaces its registration, and chuggy denies the earlier one.

## Run

Colima must be running (`colima start`, whose VM is vz with virtiofs mounts by default; other mount types are untested), with docker's context its unix socket. A job is sized against Colima's VM rather than the Mac, so start Colima with the CPUs and memory the pool's work asks for.

The runner reads `~/Library/Application Support/chuggy-darwin/runner.json`, mode 600:

```json
{
  "claudeTokenFile": "/Users/you/.config/chuggy/claude-token",
  "timeoutSecsMax": 3600,
  "outputBytesMax": 1048576
}
```

`claudeTokenFile` is where `claude setup-token`'s output was saved: mode 600, yours, and under your home, the only directory Colima shares with its VM by default, as named and through any link. `concurrencyMax` (1), `sessionsMax` (2), `environment` and `network` (`chuggy-jobs`) are optional.

```sh
./cli.mjs run --pool ~/.config/chuggy/pools/<file>     # until the plane denies the pool
./cli.mjs once --pool <file>                           # one pass
./cli.mjs status --pool <file>
./cli.mjs stop <assignment> --pool <file>
./cli.mjs doctor --pool <file>                         # everything a run needs, changing nothing
```

`CHUGGY_DARWIN_POOL` names the pool file where `--pool` does not. `run` exits 0 when the plane denies the pool, since only a new registration brings it back; `once` exits 1 on a denial as on any pass that did not reconcile. `doctor` also fails where docker's VM no longer runs the platform the pool registered, as after `colima start --arch` with another architecture, and warns where no agent serves the pool. While the pool holds work, a run keeps the Mac from idle sleep with `caffeinate -i`, since a sleeping Mac pauses the VM and the work's leases lapse; a closed lid on battery still sleeps. Each pool's control socket, pull credentials and env files live in `~/Library/Caches/chuggy-darwin/`, and ended jobs' logs in `~/Library/Logs/chuggy-darwin/`.

## Agent

```sh
./cli.mjs install-agent --pool <file>
```

This writes `~/Library/LaunchAgents/chuggy-darwin.<pool file less .json>.plist`, which runs `run` for that pool file under the `node` and with the PATH of this shell, since launchd's own PATH finds no Homebrew docker; it takes the link on PATH, such as `/opt/homebrew/bin/node`, which an upgrade keeps. It takes no other variable, so a `DOCKER_HOST` or `DOCKER_CONTEXT` set in the shell does not reach the agent, which uses docker's current context. It prints how to load it. launchd starts the agent when the user logs in to the Mac's desktop, and runs it only while they are logged in, and again after any exit but 0, after a pause, so an agent started before Colima tries again; a pool the plane denied stays down. Its output goes to `~/Library/Logs/chuggy-darwin/chuggy-darwin.<pool file less .json>.log`. `brew services start colima` starts Colima at login too.

Registering a pool its agent serves again replaces the registration the agent holds, so `register` prints the `launchctl kickstart` that restarts it.
